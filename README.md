# update-service

The Update Service re-configures vehicle ECU's with new secure images, to fix bugs and/or add new functionality. The Service also maintains the vehicle ECU state, via a manifest detailing the version information, of the released images, executing on the truck. Over the Air (OTA) packages are downloaded from Nikola Fleet Command to the vehicle and forwarded to the Update Service for processing.
The Update Service manages disemination of the images to the appropriate recipient:

1. VHU update is managed by the update service
1. VHU Peripherals are managed by the service that manages that device
  <br>a. CCU Device - CCU Service
  <br>b. RTM Device - Radio Service
  <br>c. Nordic Device - BLE Service
1. ECU Updates - CGW2 Service

## Development

The Update Service was developed in a Linux environment using the Crystal Language. Crystal was choosen since it compiles to native ARM code and provides seemless "C" language bindings.
The build environment is described in the [README.BUILD.md](https://git.nikolamotor.com/core/vhu/vhu/-/blob/main/microservices/update_service/README.BUILD.md?ref_type=heads)

### Building Update Service

#### To build and upload to your connected bench, (in docker, in service directory)

make arm && make arm install && bench sync

#### To watch the logs generated by the service (on VHU)

journalctl -uf update-service

#### To start or stop the service (on VHU)

systemctl stop update-service
systemctl start update-service
systemctl restart update-service

### Testing Update Service

Update Service is tested in a Docker container  environment, with VHU Services running, and is supported by the CGW Simulator. How to configure your docker container can be found here: [Update Service Docker Setup](https://nikolamotor.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STS/pages/3972136963/Update+Service+Docker+Setup).<br>
Running an OTA is explained here: [OTA Simulator Testing](https://nikolamotor.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STS/pages/3972071434/OTA+Simulator+Testing)

## Transport API

This section describes the messages transmitted and recieved and the operations set in motion by those messages. The service primarily recieves requests from the GUI Service and Nikola Fleet Command, in the AWS Cloud. Secondarily the service may, under service circumstances recieve requests, to assist a technician to complete an OTA when conditions are not ideal.

### Received Messages

This section describes the messages recieved by the service and the operations performed upon reciept of said message.  Below is a detailed description of the operation requested.

#### update_available-&-restage_update

Recipt of the update_available request, informs the service that an OTA package has been downloaded from Nikola Fleet Command.

##### Input

  String: path to OTA Package

##### Method Invoked

  def `stage_update`(pkg_path : String?, restage : Bool = false)<br>
  Return : `nil`
  
  or

  def `restage_update`(pkg_path : String?, restage : Bool = false)<br>
  Return : `nil`

The service processes the request by staging the OTA package recieved from Fleet Command. The package is unpacked and verified. The ECU images are sent to the CGW2 Service to securly move the images from the VHU to the Nikola CGW device. This is dome by putting the image data in shared memory and asking the requests the ADAS M4 processor to move the data from shared memory to the Nikola CGW device.<br>Below find the sequence diagram describing the ota staging process.

#### <p style="text-align:center;">VHU Staging Process Steps</p>

Further detail concerning the steps in the sequence diagram above.

- Fleet informs the Update Service that an update is available.
- Update Service unpacks the package to VHU persistant storage (SSD).
- Update Service verifies the manifest signature, and the SHA of each image in the package.
- If the verification fails?
  - send staging complete event with the failure reason and exit.

  - CGW2 Service prepares the move data, from shared memory to the Nikola CGW ECU, M4 command.
  - CGW2 Service sends the command to the M4.
  - CGW2 Service blocks on a read to the M4 to return the status of the operation.
  - M4 sends the status of the request
  - If the operation failed?
    - CGW2 Service Informs Update service of the failure.
    - Update Service Informs Fleet of the failure and exits.
  - Loop over images in package
    - Update Service requests CGW2 Service to stage an ECU image,
      - Sending the path of the image in VHU Storage.
    - CGW2 Service reads the image data from VHU Storage.
    - CHW2 Service copies the image data to shared memory accessable by the M4.
    - CGW2 Service prepares a packed command requesting the M4 to move the image data from shared memory to the CGW device via the UDS protocol.
    - CGW2 Service sends the command to the M4.
    - CGW2 Service waits on a read to the M4.
    - M4 responds with staging complete and a status.
    - If staging failed?
      - CGW2 Service Informs Update service of the failure.
      - Update Service Informs Fleet of the failure and exits.
    - CGW2 Service sends staging complete for this ECU success.
  - Update Service sends an OTA Update is available to GUI Service.
  - Update Service sends staging complete success to Fleet.
  - and main request instance
    - Update Service returns/exit.

#### update

The request to install a staged ota package.
Recipt of the update request, informs the service to install the previously staged OTA package.  This request comes from the driver via the GUI service when the driver presses the Update Button on the infotainment display.

##### Input

  package_path          : String  - path to OTA Package<br>
  origin                : String  - service name requesting the update<br>
  multi_ota_in_progress : Boolean - is this a multi package OTA or a normal single package OTA?

##### Method Invoked

The request to install a previously staged OTA Package.

Method invoked
def `run_update_with_inhibit`(package_path : String?, origin : String, multi_ota_in_progress : Bool = false)<br>
return  : Hash(String, String)?

The service then processes the request from GUI Service, by installing the staged OTA package. The service unpacks and verifies the package.  Performs checks and requests diagnostic mode<br>`Note: this request to the CGW device begins the ECU install process.`<br>The VHU is installed then the VHU Peripherals in parallel to the ECUs.  Then the service waits for the CGW2 Service to respond the completion status.<br>Below find the sequence diagram describing the ota update process.

```

#### <p style="text-align:center;">Manifest Generation Process Steps</p>

Further detail concerning the steps in the sequence diagram above.

- The driver begins the Manifest Generation Process by depressing the Manifest button on the service screen.
- Update Service requests the manifest map from GW2 Service.
- CGW2 Service reads the Manifest Map from Shared Memory.<br>`Note: manifest data only changes on update, so it is mainly static.`
- CGW2 Service returns the Manifest Map to Update Service.
- Update Service parses the manifest map extracting the versions of:
  - Hardware
  - Application
  - Boot Loader
  - Calibration
<br>  and formatting each into semver format, for each ECU on the vehicle
- Loop over the VHU Peripherals
  - Request/Receive version information from each VHU Peripheral.
- Update service compares actual/reported versions with the expected versions.  The service then generates a report to forward to Amber Service.
- The Manifest Report is sent to Amber Service.

### Transmitted Messages

The Update service transmits multiple messages during staging and update. Update Service requests the VHU Peripheral services to:

- report firmware versions
- Install a new image

The service also notifies Fleet and Amber Service of staging/install progress.  Update Service makes requests to the CGW and Vehicle State Services to support the staging or install process. The System Service is requested to save logs from events and restart the VHU to complete an update.

#### radio-service

Radio Service manages the Radio Tuning Module (RTM) device to assist OTA and radio function.

- "get_fw_version"
- "rtm_fw_update"

- "get_ccu_fw_version"
- "firmware_update"

#### ble-service

Radio Service manages the Nordic Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device to assist OTA and BLE for phone app access and BLE device reporting.

- "get_firmware_version"
- "update_dfu"

#### system-service

Update Service requests System Service to perform two functions:

1. Save off journal log files after an update or staging.
1. Reboot the VHU to switch to a new updated version of the image.

- "dump_log"
- "reboot_request"

#### amber-service

Amber service recieves unsolicited updates from update service. Update Service informs Amber Service that a new OTA package has arrived and it's staging status.   Amber Service is updated with OTA per check status, when the Infotainment Display is on the Service window.  Amber Service is also informed of the progress of any active update initiated by the driver via Amber.

#### CGW2-service

Update Service makes many requests and updates to the CGW2 Service.  They fall in three main catagories:

1. Manifest operations
1. Staging new OTA Packages
1. Installing Staged Packages

Many of the request commands below may be issued once or many times.  Generally the commands set a process in motion that can return a single status or numerous progress messages from the CGW2 Service.<br>`Note: Requests to the CGW2 Service may begin some time consuming operations and numerous status updates.`<br>`Note: CGW2 Service requests the CGW device to move data(staging) or install data to any of some 20+ ECUs.`

- Manifest Updates
  - "manifest_tx"
  - "manifest_map"

- Staging Requests
  - "stage_manifest"
  - "stage_ecus"
